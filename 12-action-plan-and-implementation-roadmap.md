## Implementation Best Practices

### 1. Start Small, Scale Gradually

> "Pilot testing with a smaller group of users is essential at this stage — it highlights workflow gaps and usability issues that need to be corrected before a full rollout." — [Phenom: SaaS Implementation Guide: Steps, Best Practices & Success Stories](https://www.phenom.com/blog/saas-implementation-guide)

**Best Practices:**
- Start with 5-10 pilot customers
- Learn deeply from early customers
- Iterate rapidly based on feedback
- Scale only after achieving product-market fit

### 2. Measure Everything

> "Select meaningful metrics. Define outcomes that matter most, such as faster cycle times, higher-quality releases, and improved customer satisfaction. Avoid weak proxies like percentage of code generated by AI, which offer little insight into real productivity." — [McKinsey: Unlocking the value of AI in software development](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/unlocking-the-value-of-ai-in-software-development)

**Key Metrics to Track:**

| Category | Metrics | Frequency |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Outcome metrics** | Success rate, quality, speed | Real-time |

| **Growth metrics** | New customers, expansion, churn | Monthly |

### 3. Build Strong Customer Success

> "Implementation doesn't end at launch. Continuous improvement keeps the platform relevant as needs evolve." — [Phenom: SaaS Implementation Guide: Steps, Best Practices & Success Stories](https://www.phenom.com/blog/saas-implementation-guide)
