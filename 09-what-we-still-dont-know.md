Will AI capabilities continue improving at current rates, or will we hit plateaus?

**Key Questions:**
- Will LLMs achieve human-level reasoning across all domains?
- What are the fundamental limits of current AI architectures?
- When will we hit diminishing returns on scale and compute?
- Will new architectures (beyond transformers) emerge?

**Implications:**
- If AI plateaus: Service-as-Software limited to current use cases
- If AI continues advancing: Entirely new categories emerge
- Timing of plateaus affects competitive dynamics
- Investment decisions depend on trajectory

**Current Indicators:**
- Scaling laws suggest continued improvements
- But early signs of diminishing returns on some benchmarks
- Architectural innovations (e.g., Mixture of Experts) still advancing
- Multi-modal capabilities expanding rapidly

### 2. Long-Term Reliability

**The Unknown:**
Can AI systems maintain high reliability over years of operation?

**Key Questions:**
- Will error rates remain stable or drift over time?
- How do models handle distribution shift?
- What happens when training data becomes outdated?
- Can systems self-correct reliably?

**Implications:**
- Reliability determines viable use cases
- Critical applications may require indefinite human oversight
- Maintenance costs may be higher than expected
- Customer trust depends on long-term performance

**Current Indicators:**
- Short-term reliability impressive (95%+ on many tasks)
- Long-term data limited (industry too new)
- Some evidence of performance drift over time
- Self-correction capabilities improving but unproven

### 3. Technical Debt Accumulation

**The Unknown:**
Will AI systems accumulate technical debt like traditional software?

**Key Questions:**
- How do we measure AI technical debt?
- What happens when models become obsolete?
- How do we migrate between model generations?
- What's the cost of maintaining legacy AI systems?

**Implications:**
- Maintenance costs may be higher than anticipated
- Migration between models may be complex
- Technical debt could limit innovation speed
- Total cost of ownership unclear

├── Verticals provide domain expertise
├── Both viable strategies
└── Market segmentation by use case

Scenario D: Fragmented Landscape
├── No clear winner
├── Many specialized players
├── Customer choice drives
└── Continuous innovation
```

**Current Indicators:**
- Both strategies being pursued
- Early evidence for both

### 12. Rollup vs. Startup Success

**The Unknown:**
Will rollup strategies or independent startups succeed?

**Key Questions:**

**Rollup Strategy:**

> "Service-as-Software is here. Large language models no longer just speed up work - they absorb it. Foundation Capital estimates $4.6 trillion in annual service spend can shift to AI-first operators. Margin follows whoever owns the customer. Buying a provider - an accounting firm, call-center outsourcer, or HVAC contractor - and dropping AI agents inside is often cheaper and faster than selling those agents one seat at a time." — [LinkedIn: How to turn services into software with AI](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jfeilberg_venture-rollups-an-emerging-asset-class-activity-7321498731663540224-BPt_)

**Rollup Advantages:**
- Existing customer relationships
- Domain expertise
- Cash flow to fund transformation
- Lower customer acquisition cost

**Startup Advantages:**
- Technology-native approach

| **Distribution** | Established | None |
| **Domain expertise** | Deep | Limited |
| **Technology** | Legacy constraints | AI-native |
